      <h2><strong>As in all wars, it is the innocents who suffer most.</strong></h2>
      <h3>The conflict took the lives of <strong>58,5 million</strong> civilians. <strong>30,5 million</strong> due to direct military activity or crimes against humanity and <strong>28 million</strong> due to famine or diseases caused by the war.</h3>

      <h2><strong>Most of the civilian losses occurred on the Allies side.</strong></h2>
      <h3>This is mainly due to the harsh offensive with cruel occupation carried out by the Axis and the countless war crimes committed by them.</h3>

      <h2><strong>The biggest number of military deaths was from the USSR due to Operation Barbarossa.</strong></h2>
      <h3>On 22 June 1941 Germany invades the Soviet Union with three million German troops supported by Italian, Hungarian, Romanian and Finnish allies.<br>Stalin was taken by surprise and the Soviets were forced to retreat. The Germans used Blitzkrieg tactics and one week the Soviets suffered <strong>150,000</strong> casualties. The operation took the lives of more than <strong>1 million</strong> Axis troops and <strong>5 million</strong> Soviet soldiers.</h3>

      <h2><strong>When we consider all deaths, new countries emerge.</strong></h2>
      <h3>Some countries suffered great civilian losses despite not participating so actively in the war. <strong>Poland (6M)</strong> suffered heavy losses due to the deliberate and systematic genocide during the Nazi-Soviet occupation (1939–1945). <strong>Dutch East Indies (4M)</strong> (1942–1945) and <strong>French Indochina (2M)</strong> (1940–1945) suffered from famine and forced labour ocasioned by the Japanese occupation. <strong>India (3M)</strong> also suffered from famine due to British policies and scorched-earth aproach.</h3>

      <h2><strong>Some battles turned the tide of war.</strong></h2>
      <h3>A German offensive in August 1942 stalls and the Red Army holds on in <strong>Stalingrad</strong> until the Russian winter arrives. It is one of the bloodiest battles in history with nearly two million military and civilian casualties. House-to-house fighting drags on until 2 February 1943. <strong>868,374</strong> Axis and <strong>1,129,619</strong> Soviets troops died.</h3>
      <h3>On September 8, 1941 the siege of <strong>Leningrad</strong> begins. The Nazi objective was to destroy the city and its population. The siege lasted two and a half years and more than <strong>1 million</strong> civilians died due to diseases and starvation.</h3>
      <h3>In comparison, D-day deaths are less than 10,000</h3>

      <h2><strong>Absolute numbers cannot tell the whole story.</strong></h2>
      <h3><strong>Poland</strong> lost about <strong>6 million</strong> citizens, nearly <strong>17%</strong> of Poland's population, between 1939 and 1945. The Polish citizens also suffered forced labour in concentration and extermination camps where <strong>3 million</strong> Jews lost their lives. Over <strong>90%</strong> of the deaths were non-military losses. Most polish civilians were deliberately targeted in various actions which were launched by the Germans and Soviets including a process of Germanization.</h3>

      <h3>The Soviet republic of Belarus lost <strong>25%</strong> of its <strong>9 million</strong> population due to bloody encirclement battles during the fighting and German occupation. The population was exterminated for German colonization or deported to slave labour camps. At least <strong>5,295</strong> Belarusian settlements were destroyed by the Nazis and some or all their inhabitants killed and more than <strong>600</strong> villages were annihilated with their entire population.</h3>

      <h2><strong>The Holocaust.</strong></h2>
      <h3>Between 1941 and 1945, across German-occupied Europe, Nazi Germany and its collaborators systematically massacred <strong>6 million</strong> Jews, around <strong>two-thirds</strong> of Europe's Jewish population.</h3>
      <h3>Paramilitary death squads, in cooperation with the German Army and local collaborators, murdered around <strong>1.3 million</strong> Jews in mass shootings and pogroms between 1941 and 1945. By mid-1942 until 1945, victims were being deported from ghettos across Europe in sealed freight trains to extermination camps where they were gassed, worked or beaten to death, or killed by disease or during death marches.</h3>

      <h3><br>We must remember those who fell. They show us that war is unjust, war is ugly, war is futile, war is stupid, war is hell, and above all, war is a mistake. A mistake paid with lives. A mistake that we need to ensure is not repeated.</h3>
